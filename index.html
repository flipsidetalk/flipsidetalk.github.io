                We believe that the only way to reverse increased polarization is to gain an understanding and respect for the other side of an issue. But, it is often hard to relate to the arguments used by the other side. By studying the articles you’ve liked and shared online, the FlipSide algorithm figures out which articles from the other side you might actually find interesting, and then inserts them into your feed. This makes balancing and better informing your perspective as easy as signing up.

                <h3>Solid Liberal</h3>
                <p>Generally affluent and highly educated, most Solid Liberals strongly support the social safety net and take very liberal positions on virtually all issues. Most say they always vote Democratic and are unflagging supporters of Barack Obama. Overall, Solid Liberals are very optimistic about the nation’s future and are the most likely to say that America’s success is linked to its ability to change, rather than its reliance on long-standing principles. On foreign policy, Solid Liberals overwhelmingly believe that good diplomacy – rather than military strength – is the best way to ensure peace.</p>

              <div id="faith-fam" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Faith and Family Left</h3>
                <p>The Faith and Family Left combine strong support for activist government with conservative attitudes on many social issues. They are very racially diverse – this is the only typology group that is “majority-minority.” The Faith and Family Left generally favor increased government aid for the poor even if it adds to the deficit and believe that government should do more to solve national problems. Most oppose same-sex marriage and legalizing marijuana and most say religion and family are at the center of their lives. </p>
              </div>
              <div id="next-gen" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Next Generation Left</h3>
                <p>Generally young, well-educated and financially comfortable, the Next Generation Left have very liberal attitudes on many issues, including homosexuality, abortion, the environment and foreign policy. While overall supportive of an activist government, most are wary of expanding the social safety net. Most also have relatively positive views of Wall Street’s impact on the economy. While most affiliate with the Democratic Party or lean Democratic, few consider themselves strong Democrats.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="skeptic" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Hard-Pressed Skeptic</h3>
                <p>Deeply financially-stressed and distrustful of government, Hard-Pressed Skeptics have reservations about both political parties, but more lean toward the Democratic Party. In general, they want government to do more to solve problems, but have doubts about its efficiency. Hard-Pressed Skeptics are among the most cynical about the ability of individuals to improve their lot through hard work. These attitudes may reflect their distressed financial conditions: Hard-Pressed Skeptics have the lowest average family incomes of any of the typology groups.</p>

              <div id="outsider" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Young Outsiders</h3>
                <p>This relatively young, largely independent group holds a mix of conservative and liberal views. And while more lean toward the Republican Party than the Democratic Party, Young Outsiders generally express unfavorable opinions of both major parties. They are largely skeptical of activist government, as a substantial majority views government as wasteful and inefficient. Yet many diverge from the two conservative typology groups – Steadfast Conservatives and Business Conservatives – in their strong support for the environment and many liberal social policies.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="biz-con" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Business Conservative</h3>
                <p>Business Conservatives generally are traditional small-government Republicans. Overwhelming percentages think that government is almost always wasteful and it does too much better left to businesses and individuals. Business Conservatives differ from Steadfast Conservatives in their positive attitudes toward business and in their strong support for Wall Street in particular. Most think that immigrants strengthen the country and take a positive view of U.S. global involvement. As a group, they are less socially conservative than Steadfast Conservatives.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="steadfast-con" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Steadfast Conservative</h3>
                <p>This overwhelmingly Republican group holds very conservative attitudes across most issues, including social policy and the size and scope of government. However, they generally are critical of business and Wall Street. Overall, Steadfast Conservatives also express highly negative attitudes toward immigrants and take a skeptical view of U.S. global involvement.</p>
